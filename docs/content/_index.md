# fle[ksz]ible

Flekszible is a Kubernetes configuration/manifest manager. It helps to manage your kubernetes yaml files before the deployment.

 * Flekszible generates the final k8s yaml files based on source yaml file + easy to use transformation rules
 * Everything can be versioned as the final files are generated and saved (GitOps)
 * Transformation rules can be reused and shared (It has a powerful but extremely simple package management)
 * It combines the best part of the composition based and template based approach (it's composition based but in reusable transformation rule definition you can use templates)

## Features:

  1. Zero-config: it can work without any external files
  2. Mixins: you can define additional transformations to change k8s resources
  3. Imports: You can compose resources from multiple sources (github repositories)
  4. Multi-tenancy: With imports you can manage multiple environments (dev,prod,...)
  5. Multi-instance: You can import the same template (eg. zookeeper resources) with different flavour. With this approach you can create two different zookeeper ring from a template to your cluster.
  6. Reusable transformations: you can define transformations and reuse them later (or provide them to the user as optional flags.)
  7. Package management:  Simple github based package management. No separated repository format just github repositories and tags.
  8. Side-car pattern friendly design: additional side-car containers can be injected
  10. __build time transformation_: compared to the oprerator pattern, here everything is visible as the transformations are applied on build time before using `kubectl apply -f`. It's more safe to switch between environments.
  11. GitOps friendy: generates all the final resources to static files
  12. Supports external processors like service-mesh injectors

## Comparison

 * **Flekszible vs Helm**: 
   * Flekszible is based on composition instead of templates (it's more like Kustomize)
   * No server side component the final deployment will be handled by kubectl
   * But it's more flexible: you can modify any part of the source kubernetes resources
   * You don't need to add a lot of golang template conditions to customize all the parts of k8s resources
   * The package management is simpified (No other repository formats just plain git repositories. Registry is based on github tags and stars)
 * **Flekszible vs Kustomize**:
   * It has less limitations. Flekszible is designed to be as flexible as possible with keeping the complexity on minimal.
   * It's more generic design (generic Yaml tree + transformations instead of k8s resource merging)
   * It has one generic patching style, which can be used to define high level transformations.
   * It tries to be more user friendly (easier syntax, flexible composition, it can work without registering any resource file)
   * It has a simple but powerful package management (base on git repos)
   * The transformations are *reusable*
   * Service-mesh friendly, any external command can be invoked.
